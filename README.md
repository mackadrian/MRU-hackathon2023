MRU 2023 Hackathon project

The following project was an attempt to create our first Hackathon project. Unfortunately due to limited experience and knowledge, 
we attempted to create a concept of a game through the console of Eclipse. 

This is a interactive text game that has 3 different minigames that reflect the kind of educational content that people of different age ranges experience. 
The first game is a match the shape game that a toddler may go through. 
The second game is a trivia section for early childhood to pre-teen ages using the different subjects within a typical school curriculum as a guideline. 
The third game is a decision simulator reflecting some basic decisions/consequences that a teenager may experience that shows progression in their personal assets and traits.

Our next step...
Envision it through a game engine or chase the ambitious goal of creating everything by scratch.
